sass-twitter-bootstrap  - It's not a gem, but a set of sass templates for twitter-bootstrap
compass-twitter-bootstrap - This is a gem for rails
bootstrap-sass - This is a gem for rails

which is the right gem to use ?

It doesn't make sense, import twitter bootstrap from base.scss doesn't work throws following error. 


	Sass::SyntaxError in Homes#index

	Showing /home/vangapal/core-src/c-shopping/app/views/layouts/application.html.slim where line #7 raised:

	Invalid CSS after "@import ": expected file to import (string or url()), was "compass"
	  (in /home/vangapal/core-src/c-shopping/app/assets/stylesheets/base.scss)

	Extracted source (around line #7):

But import same twitter bootstrap from base.sass , it works without any issues.
